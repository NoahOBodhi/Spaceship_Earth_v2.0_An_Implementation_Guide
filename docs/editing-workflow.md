# Chapter Editing Workflow

## 8-Step Systematic Revision Process

This workflow ensures consistent, high-quality revisions across all chapters.

## Pre-Work

1. **Read the Style Guide** (docs/style-guide-summary.md)
2. **Review Chapter 1** as exemplar
3. **Identify session goal** - Don't try to perfect everything at once

---

## Step 1: Assess Current State

**Check the chapter for:**
- [ ] Header elements present (version, crew stage, reading time, RBF quote)?
- [ ] Footer elements present (next chapter, progression, key concepts, milestone)?
- [ ] Current narrative/bullet ratio?
- [ ] Fuller quotes appropriately used (early, then integrated naturally)?
- [ ] Abundance framing consistent?
- [ ] Technical credibility balanced with emotional resonance?
- [ ] Crew development stage matches position in book?

---

## Step 2: Map Development Arc

**Answer these questions:**
- Where does this chapter fit in 18-chapter progression?
- What should reader be able to do/recognize by chapter end?
- What was achieved in previous chapter?
- What needs to be ready for next chapter?
- What's the specific crew development milestone?

---

## Step 3: Structural Revision

**Add/fix required elements:**
- [ ] Add header if missing
- [ ] Add footer if missing
- [ ] Check 60/40 narrative/bullet balance
- [ ] Convert sections as needed:
  - Lists → Narrative (if explaining WHY or building emotion)
  - Narrative → Bullets (if showing parallel mechanisms/specifications)
- [ ] Add recognition moments ("You've probably noticed...")
- [ ] Strengthen transitions between sections (show synergy)

---

## Step 4: Language Revision

**Pass through chapter fixing:**
- [ ] Replace scarcity language with abundance framing
- [ ] Shift passive voice to active voice
- [ ] Change "one" or "users" to "you"
- [ ] Add emotional validation where appropriate
- [ ] Ensure progressive development language matches stage
- [ ] Check Fuller references (introduced early, then integrated)
- [ ] Remove repetitive Fuller attribution phrases

---

## Step 5: Technical Enhancement

**Strengthen credibility:**
- [ ] Add specific technologies and protocols (names, not just concepts)
- [ ] Include mathematical/logical reasoning where relevant
- [ ] Ground abstractions in concrete examples
- [ ] Reference research appropriately (accuracy matters, not citations)
- [ ] Demonstrate systems thinking explicitly
- [ ] Show implementation reality (it exists, not theoretical)

---

## Step 6: Emotional Connection

**Enhance reader engagement:**
- [ ] Add "you've probably noticed" moments
- [ ] Validate reader experience ("your frustration is intelligence")
- [ ] Acknowledge appropriate emotions ("if you're angry, that's right")
- [ ] Connect abstractions to lived reality
- [ ] Show reader capability ("you're developing..." not "you lack...")
- [ ] Use examples from daily digital life

---

## Step 7: Integration

**Connect to larger work:**
- [ ] Add forward references ("we'll explore this in Chapter X")
- [ ] Add backward references ("as you recognized in Chapter Y")
- [ ] Link to CARE$ system where relevant (especially Ch 8-13)
- [ ] Reference mission framework if applicable (especially Ch 11-13)
- [ ] Connect to crew roles (Strategists, Builders, Connectors, Catalysts)
- [ ] Ensure terminology consistency with other chapters

---

## Step 8: Quality Check

**Final verification:**
- [ ] All required header elements present and correct?
- [ ] All required footer elements present and correct?
- [ ] 60/40 narrative/bullet ratio maintained?
- [ ] Technical credibility + emotional resonance balanced?
- [ ] Progression appropriate to chapter position?
- [ ] Reading time accurate (~225 words/minute)?
- [ ] Version number and date updated?

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Trying to perfect everything in one pass** - Focus on one goal per session
2. **Losing abundance framing** - Constantly check language
3. **Over-abstracting** - Ground concepts in concrete examples
4. **Under-validating** - Readers need emotional recognition
5. **Breaking progression** - Each chapter builds on previous

---

## Session Best Practices

### Time Management
- **Quick pass:** 30-45 minutes (one specific improvement)
- **Standard revision:** 2-3 hours (complete one section)
- **Full chapter revision:** 6-8 hours over multiple sessions

### Quality Over Speed
- One well-revised section > three mediocre sections
- Take breaks between major revisions
- Review Chapter 1 when stuck

### Version Control
- Update version number after each major revision
- Update date
- Track what changed in commit messages

**Remember:** This is progressive development. Each session improves the chapter. Perfection comes through iteration.
