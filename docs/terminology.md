# Terminology Standards

## Consistent Language Guidelines

This reference ensures consistent terminology across all chapters.

## Core Terms

### Always Use → Never Use

**Project & Content:**
- Implementation Guide → Operating Manual
- Canonical → authoritative, official
- Fork → branch (for implementations)

**People:**
- Crew member → user, participant, person
- Reader → audience, consumer
- You/your → one, users, people

**Concepts:**
- Abundance → prosperity, wealth, affluence
- Extraction → exploitation
- Recognition → awareness, consciousness
- Comprehensive intelligence → knowledge, wisdom
- Crew consciousness → mindfulness, awareness
- Operating instructions → algorithms, code (unless specifically technical)

**Systems:**
- Regenerative → sustainable (sustainable is less precise)
- Resource democracy → resource allocation
- Coordination → control, management
- CARE$ → alternative currency (unless defining it)

**Technology:**
- Privacy-preserving → anonymous, private
- Decentralized → distributed (when referring to governance)
- Blockchain → cryptocurrency (unless specifically about currency)

## Chapter-Specific Terms

### Chapters 1-3: System Recognition
- Pattern recognition (not pattern detection)
- System diagnosis (not analysis)
- Fragmented intelligence (not incomplete knowledge)

### Chapters 4-7: Technology Toolkit
- Intelligence amplifier (not AI assistant)
- Truth infrastructure (not verification system)
- Freedom foundation (not security measures)
- Planetary sensing (not data collection)

### Chapters 8-10: Operating System
- Synergistic stack (not integrated platform)
- Crew interface (not user interface)
- Resource democracy (not allocation system)

### Chapters 11-13: Implementation
- Bootstrap sequence (not implementation plan)
- Tipping point (not critical mass)
- Immunity protocols (not resistance strategies)

### Chapters 14-18: Planetary Scale
- Resource orchestration (not resource management)
- Learning system (not feedback loops)
- Empowered crew (not engaged users)
- Creative civilization (not innovative society)
- Cosmic perspective (not long-term view)

## R. Buckminster Fuller References

**First mention in each chapter:**
- Full name: R. Buckminster Fuller
- Include brief context if relevant

**Subsequent mentions:**
- Fuller (preferred)
- Buckminster Fuller (occasionally for emphasis)
- RBF (only in technical/meta contexts)

**Attribution style:**
- Quotes: Italicized with attribution
- Concepts: "Fuller recognized that..."
- Avoid: "As Fuller said," "Fuller stated," "Fuller claimed"

## Tone & Voice

### Active Voice Patterns
✅ "You recognize patterns"
❌ "Patterns are recognized"

✅ "The system extracts value"
❌ "Value is extracted by the system"

### Direct Address
✅ "You've probably noticed..."
❌ "One might notice..." or "Users often notice..."

✅ "Your frustration is intelligence"
❌ "This frustration indicates intelligence"

### Abundance Framing
✅ "Enabling coordination"
❌ "Reducing inefficiency"

✅ "Amplifying capability"
❌ "Overcoming limitations"

## Technical Terminology

### Be Specific
✅ "TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX"
❌ "AI frameworks"

✅ "Ethereum, Polygon, or Avalanche"
❌ "Blockchain platforms"

✅ "Zero-knowledge proofs"
❌ "Privacy technologies"

### Balance Accessibility
- Define technical terms on first use
- Provide concrete examples
- Connect to daily experience
- Don't oversimplify

## Progressive Development Language

### Chapter 1 (Initial Recognition)
"You're beginning to see..."
"You've probably noticed..."
"Recognition is developing..."

### Chapter 10 (System Design)
"You can now design..."
"With this understanding..."
"You're ready to architect..."

### Chapter 18 (Full Crew Operation)
"You're operating..."
"You've developed..."
"You coordinate..."

## Validation Language

### Emotional Recognition
✅ "If you're angry, that's appropriate"
✅ "Your frustration indicates intelligence"
✅ "This recognition can be unsettling"

### Capability Building
✅ "You're developing..."
❌ "You lack..."

✅ "You're ready to..."
❌ "You need to..."

✅ "You can now..."
❌ "You should..."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't mix metaphors:** Stick with spaceship/crew terminology
2. **Avoid jargon:** Unless technical precision requires it
3. **No hedging:** "Can" not "might," "will" not "could"
4. **Specificity:** Name actual technologies, not categories
5. **Consistency:** Use same term throughout, don't vary for style
